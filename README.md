# ALFjs

ALFjs is a tiny JavaScript framework that I use in my own projects. It's based on the idea of jQuery but then with extremly small code. I know there are many improvements that could be made, but this is just a start. I will add more when I build my web-applications.
I'm happy with improvements that you guys could make!
